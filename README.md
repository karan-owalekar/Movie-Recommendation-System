# Movie-Recommendation-System

> This is a simple movie recommendation system based on the ratings and number of overall reviews recieved by a movie.

> For this project I used MovieLens dataset which had 10 million ratings 100,000 tag applications applied to 10,000 movies by 72,000 users. 

> This project takes advantage of Pandas dataframe.corrwith() to compute pairwise correlation between user ratings.

> By eleminating movies with less than 150 or 100 reviews, obtained results are quiet accurate.
